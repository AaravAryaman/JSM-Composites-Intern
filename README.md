# 1-Week Training @ JSM Composites

In this training, I was tasked with learning and understanding how carbon fibres, or other composites like EPP (Expanded Poly Propylene) in general, are used to make products in the industry.  
And, learning the functionalities involved in the process of machining composites like Feed Rate, Material Removal Rate, Spindle Speed, Cutting Speed, Stepover and Stepdown. Also learnt about the various types and sizes of endmills used for different required purposes.  
  
I completed a simple CAD model for machining, uploaded as [JSM-01](https://github.com/AaravAryaman/JSM-Composites-Training/tree/main/JSM-01).  
Also, I made some required modifications in some of the more complex CAD models already in work, uploaded as [NW propeller case](https://github.com/AaravAryaman/JSM-Composites-Training/tree/main/NW%20propeller%20case) and [PCU EPP PACKAGING](https://github.com/AaravAryaman/JSM-Composites-Training/tree/main/PCU%20EPP%20PACKAGING).  
  
Meanwhile, I learnt the process of making carbon fibre sheets from carbon fibres using the hand lay-up method, alternating the unidirectional fibres vertically and horizontally for strength and using the diagonal fibres as outside surface finish, while thoroughly applying a resin mixture between each layer.  
  
I also learnt about methods of making hollow composite structures using moulds- split moulding, handmade moulding and 3D printed moulding.  
Lastly, I was tasked to first create a CAD model for a [4-way 3D Connector](https://github.com/AaravAryaman/JSM-Composites-Training/tree/main/4-way%203D%20Connector) and to figure out ways to produce such a structure as a product. After considering the complexity of the design, I concluded that a 3D printed mould should be the way to go, and so I also created a concept CAD model of the required [4-way 3D Connector Mould](https://github.com/AaravAryaman/JSM-Composites-Training/tree/main/4-way%203D%20Connector%20Mould).
